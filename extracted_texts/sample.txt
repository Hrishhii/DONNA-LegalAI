CASE STUDY 1  
UNIVERSITY BOARD
(SCENARIO)
Since graduation you have maintained close links with your old 
university of which you are deeply fond. You have been invited to 
join its governing body. The letter of invitation makes particular 
reference to your “judicial knowledge and your authority in the 
local community”. The position is unpaid but will take a lot of your 
time. There has been much criticism of the university in the 
press over recent months, in particular regarding the huge sal-
ary of its President, the controversial courses it is running, and 
the lack of an ethnic mix amongst its undergraduates. The Reg-
istrar is currently on suspension following reports of financial 
irregularities. Should you accept the invitation?

CASE STUDY 5  
JUDGE MCKENZIE 
(SCENARIO)
Judge McKenzie is 48 years old. He is a married man with two 
teenage children. He is looking forward to participating in a  
conference on international regulatory law on a Caribbean 
Island. He has been asked to give a paper on the state of law in 
his country on the conference topic. The conference will be 
attended by judges and lawyers from across the world. His econ-
omy air fare is paid for by his court as are the fares of the two 
people accompanying him, a junior judge in his court, and his 
female clerk. He will receive a cash per diem from the confer-
ence organizers in the local currency upon arrival, to cover the 
cost of his hotel accommodation and meals during the confer-
ence. The following sequence of events occurs:
•	 Upon check-in, he is allocated a seat with his two colleagues at 
the rear of the plane. He later returns to the check-in desk 
stating that he has a bad back (not true) and also, he is a judge. 
He is subsequently upgraded to Business Class. He does not 
inform his colleagues.
•	 Armed with his Business Class ticket he goes to the VIP lounge 
and enjoys a free meal, and drinks. On leaving, he takes a  
couple of small miniatures of alcohol, as he sees others doing 
so, despite notices stating they are not to be taken from the 
lounge.


-- Page 18--
•	 Upon arrival at the destination airport, Judge McKenzie heads 
for the VIP exit on the basis that he is a judge travelling in 
Business Class. He waves to his two colleagues, lost in a long 
immigration queue.
•	 Upon exiting the airport, he bumps into an old friend, an attrac-
tive widowed judge who lives locally. She immediately invites 
him and his colleagues to dinner with her at her villa. He 
accepts, but declines on behalf of his colleagues, without con-
sulting them, claiming they will be “too tired”. 
•	 At the end of a happy evening, his friend suggests he stays in 
her villa with her for the duration of the conference, in the 
guest suite. He willingly accepts.
•	 Upon arrival at the conference the next day, he claims his per 
diem expenses for the conference “to cover all meals and 
accommodation.” 
•	 During the day he telephones his wife and children telling 
them that his hotel accommodation is “fantastic”.
•	 On Day 2 of the conference, feeling a little guilty towards his 
colleagues, he treats them to dinner in an expensive local res-
taurant.
•	 Before returning home, the Judge buys his host a sumptuous 
bouquet of flowers as a “thank you” gesture. He also leaves  
a generous donation to her favourite charity “Donkeys in  
Distress”.
•	 Judge McKenzie does not deliver a paper at the conference 
stating that he unfortunately left it in his office back home. He 
had not written any paper. He does however take copious notes 
at the conference with the intention of briefing his judicial 
colleagues on his return.

CASE STUDY 6  
THE VENERABLE JUDGE 
(SCENARIO)
Judge K is venerable, charming and much loved. He is the sec-
ond most senior judge in your courthouse. He is also very slow, 
and his cases take on average twice as long to complete as those 
of his colleagues (because, he says, he is “thorough”). He likes 
women, and often comments on their appearance when they 
attend as witnesses or counsel in his court. He has always 
ensured that if at all possible he has a female clerk to assist in 
the running of his court, as he says “women are more reliable 
and hardworking than men”. One of his favourite sayings over 
lunch with fellow judges in the courthouse is “cherchez la 
femme!”, but it is not usually clear in what context! Since you 
joined as the youngest female judge in the courthouse, he has 
been keen that you sit next to him when you attend such lunches, 
so he can “show you the ropes”. Most of the other young judges 
are male and he does not seem to have the same need to show 
them any “ropes”. You are unhappy and feel compromised. What 
should you do?
