# DONNA - Domain-Specific Legal AI Assistant  

> *"AI is transforming industries - but law remains locked in complexity. DONNA aims to change that."*  

**DONNA** (Domain-Oriented Neural Network Assistant) is a legal AI system designed to make legal documents and processes **accessible, understandable, and efficient**. It combines **state-of-the-art LLMs** with **intelligent retrieval pipelines** to assist lawyers, students, and citizens in navigating complex legal information.  

---

## Why DONNA?  

- Legal information is often **dense, inaccessible, and intimidating**.  
- Most AI assistants are **general-purpose**, not optimized for law.  
- Access to justice requires **simpler, transparent tools**.  

**DONNA bridges this gap** by offering:  

- **Automated Legal Summaries** - from lengthy judgments to concise insights.  
- **Legal Q&A (Chat)** - ask a question, get a clear explanation in plain English.  
- **Global Legal News Digest** - stay updated with trending global legal developments.  

This makes DONNA not just an AI project - but a **step toward democratizing legal knowledge**.

## Highlights  

- **Multi-LLM Architecture**  
  - *Groq Llama 3* for precision legal reasoning  
  - *Google Gemini Flash* for structured summarization  
- **RAG-Powered Pipeline**  
  - Smart chunking + semantic retrieval (Chroma + HuggingFace embeddings)  
- **Human-Centered Design**  
  - Session-based chat (temporary memory, like a legal co-pilot)  
  - Inline news digest (no distraction, no extra clicks)  
- **Efficiency First**  
  - Embedding caching for fast re-queries  
  - GPU/CPU-optimized batching

## Example Use Cases  

- **Law Students**: Quickly summarize 200-page case law before class.  
- **Lawyers**: Ask direct questions from a client's contract PDF.  
- **Policy Analysts**: Track global legal reforms in real time.  
- **Citizens**: Understand your rights without needing to parse jargon.

## Technical Design  

- **Core Logic**: Python + LangChain  
- **Models**: Groq Llama 3 (Q&A), Gemini Flash (Summarization)  
- **Database**: ChromaDB (embedding storage & retrieval)  
- **Frontend (planned)**: React + Tailwind (modern, minimal UI)  
- **API Layer (planned)**: FastAPI (for scalability + integrations)  
- **Cache**: Session-based (temporary) + optional MongoDB (persistent)

## Research Basis  

- *Attention Is All You Need* - Vaswani et al. (2017)  
- *Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP* - Lewis et al. (2020)  
- Recent advancements in **domain-specific LLMs** & **efficient retrieval pipelines**  

---

## Vision  

DONNA is a step toward **domain-specific AI assistants** that move beyond general-purpose chatbots. By focusing on law - an area deeply tied to fairness, justice, and society - DONNA demonstrates how **AI can reduce barriers, empower citizens, and transform industries**.
