# ⚖️ DONNA – Document-Oriented Neural Network Assistant for Legal AI

**DONNA** is a GenAI-powered project designed to assist with legal document understanding by:
- 🔍 Summarizing long legal judgments
- ❓ Answering specific legal questions
- 📄 Processing PDF-based legal documents

> Inspired by Harvey Specter. Built by Hrishikesh Raparthi.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Develop a full-stack AI assistant capable of:
1. Extracting and cleaning text from complex legal PDFs
2. Summarizing legal judgments using Transformer models
3. Handling domain-specific legal question answering
4. Converting responses into speech using TTS (planned)

## 🧠 Powered by TALQS

DONNA is built on top of **TALQS** (Transformer-based Architecture for Legal Question Answering & Summarization), which defines the end-to-end pipeline involving:
- PDF-to-text parsing
- Document chunking
- Transformer-based summarization
- Legal question answering
- Text-to-speech (planned)

This layered architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and AI explainability.
