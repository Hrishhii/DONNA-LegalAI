# 🚀 DONNA Impact Log – 10 April 2025

## ✅ Completed Tasks

- 🏗 Finalized high-level architecture for **DONNA – Domain-Oriented Neural Network Assistant**
  - 🔹 Decided to support **one PDF per session** for clarity and simplicity
  - 🔹 Architecture updated to include distinct folders: `input_pdfs/` and `extracted_texts/`

- 📁 Created new project directories:
  - `input_pdfs/` – for user-uploaded PDFs
  - `extracted_texts/` – for storing extracted text from PDFs

- 🧠 Clarified DONNA's scope:
  - 🤖 Acts as a **mini-ChatGPT for law**, ~5% of ChatGPT’s capabilities
  - 📄 Can handle:
    - PDF summarization
    - Legal QA based on uploaded document
    - Answering general law questions (without a document)
  - 🧹 No memory of previous interactions (stateless)

- 💻 Developed backend module: `extractor.py`
  - Implemented with `PyMuPDF` (fitz)
  - Automatically takes the first PDF in `input_pdfs/`, extracts text, and saves to `extracted_texts/`
  - Clean I/O with meaningful logs for user

- 🔐 Committed changes to GitHub with clean, purpose-driven commit messages for:
  - Directory setup
  - `extractor.py` logic

## 🔜 Next Up
- 🔁 Begin work on `summarizer.py`
- 🧠 Design transformer pipeline to process extracted text and generate concise summaries
- 🖼️ Start sketching frontend interface: input box, file upload, summarized output, and Q&A interaction
