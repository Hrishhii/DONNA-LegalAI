# 🚀 DONNA Impact Log – 16 April 2025

## ✅ Completed Tasks

- 🧱 Developed and tested chunker.py for breaking down extracted legal text into chunks.

 -➕ Implemented overlapping chunk strategy (200 characters overlap) to maintain context between segments

 -🐞 Resolved file reading errors from extracted_texts/ due to incorrect file paths

 -📏 With max_chunk_size = 1000, produced ~22 coherent chunks from sample document

-🧪 Evaluated transformer models for legal text summarization:

 -🔹 Primary choice: facebook/bart-large-cnn

 -🔹 Alternatives: google/pegasus, t5-base, allenai/led-base-16384

-🎯 Defined purpose of summarizer:

 -To generate readable, concise summaries of dense legal documents

 -Make legal text accessible to non-lawyers or users unfamiliar with legal jargon

## 💡 Key Decisions

-✅ Adopted facebook/bart-large-cnn for its efficiency and wide support

-🧱 Continue using chunk-based processing before summarization to stay within model limits

## 🔜 Next Up

-🛠 Begin building summarizer.py

 -Load and summarize individual chunks using selected transformer

 -Optionally merge chunk summaries into a unified abstract

-🔄 Prepare for future integration with DONNA’s Q&A module
